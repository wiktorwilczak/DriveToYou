"# DriveToYou" 

This project is my interpretation of an exercise that I have found on the <a href="https://notehub.org/9pk10">Internet</a>.

I did it only by myself, only for training purpose. Solution includes Back-END project (DriveToYou Folder, .NET Framework), along with Front-END (DriveToYou.UI, AngularJS). Screenshots from working project are in <a href="Screenshots">ScreenShots</a> Folder.
