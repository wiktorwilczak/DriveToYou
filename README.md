"# DriveToYou" 

This project is my interpretation of an exercise that I have found in the <a href="https://notehub.org/9pk10">internet</a> (exercise.html in project folder).

I did it only by myself, only for training. Solution includes Back-END project (DriveToYou Folder, .NET Framework), along with Front-END (DriveToYou.UI, AngularJS). Screenshots from working project are in "ScreenShots" Folder.
